## The Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Society

Greenwald, S.J. and Thomley, J.E. (Eds). (2011). _The Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Society, Vols. 1-3_. Pasadena, CA: Salem Press. ISBN: 978-1-58765-844-0, e-ISBN: 978-1-58765-848-8

_The goal of The	Encyclopedia	of	Mathematics	and	Society is to weave multilayered connections between society, history, people, applications, and mathematics ... In general, the articles do not teach or present detailed mathematical theory, derivations, and equations ... Instead, we intended them to serve as a foundation and jumping-off point for additional explorations. As mathematics professor and educator Art Johnson has noted in other settings, we hope that this type of contextualization helps people to "see mathematics as a discipline that transcends culture, time, and gender, and as a discipline for everyone, everywhere."_ (Introduction, p. x)

"This enlightening, well-written set, which has no current competitors, is highly recommended for all public and academic libraries. The material offers an entirely new way of looking at things." --- [Library Journal](https://www.libraryjournal.com/) Best Reference, 2011  

Digital access to the _Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Society_ is available through the [ASU Library](https://library.appstate.edu/).
