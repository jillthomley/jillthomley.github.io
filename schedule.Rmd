<hr>

I am teaching online this semester and will rarely be physically in my office. Students enrolled in my classes should use their private forums on AsULearn to contact me electronically, as directed in their syllabus. I will not answer direct email from students who are currently in my classes, unless it is an emergency. Changes to this schedule will be announced to students via Course Announcements on AsULearn.

The number of office hours offered in a given semester is a function of the credit hours of standard classes a professor is teaching. You can book Office Hour appointments in 15-minute increments [HERE](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU0zQUk4blgtNW44fGRlZmF1bHR8Y2EyZDZmYTMxNmZjMWEwMjdiMzE0ZjQ1MmEwNDFjMmE). If you feel like you will need more than 15 minutes, book more than one slot. Drop-ins are also welcome, but scheduled appointments will take priority. Zoom links are available on AsULearn.
